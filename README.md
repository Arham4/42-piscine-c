that may or may not have white-spaces. - ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Failed with 0%
- **Group Project: Rush 02** - Make a program that is a 
Rush-00-identifier. The program should take in input from
the standard input and identify which sub-Rush-00 project
was executed. - ![#98fb98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/98fb98/000000?text=+) Succeeded with 100%
- **BSQ** - Find the largest square in a 2-dimensional character
matrix and mark it with a given "fill" character. The program
should read from both standard input and from files. Grading
was done not only by functionality, but by the efficiency of
the program in both speed and memory. Only about 1% of Pisciners
have ever had success in this project. - ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Failed with 0%

Final Piscine level: **7.4**

### Grading at 42
Grading is done by an auto-grader called Moulinette. "She" 
requires assignments to be pushed to the respective Git 
repository by 11:42 PM. Once pushed, one is required to get
evaluated by their peers (with the exception of Rush projects).
For the daily projects, one must get evaluated two times, while
for the individual projects one must get evaluated three times.
After one is evaluated by their peers, Moulinette grades the user.
**She is strict.** The moment an exercise is marked wrong, she
stops incrementing one's grade. That is, for example, **if one 
did 10 exercises in a day and got 9 of the exercises correct, 
but the first exercise wrong, they would get a 0 for the day.**


She could experience a time-out (a program never ending), a KO
(an incorrect output), or a Norme-error. All projects are
required to respect The Norm, which is a set of rules. For 
example, one may not have more than 25 lines in a function, a 
line may not have more than 80 characters, a file may not have 
more  than 5 functions, the declaration of all variables must 
be at  the top of the function, declaration and initialization
of variables in the same line is forbidden, and many more, 
with the aforementioned ones being the most common.

One is regarded as "successful" in a given project (besides Rush)
if one gets a 25 or above. In a Rush, one requires a 50 to have
success.

Only one problem with the project: Cannot read STDIN correctly 
(when it is inserted using the < notation). I.E.:

./bsq < test1.txt test2.txt
```
